# Word-Constructor

## GOAL
This program will have a user play a game 
that is constructed using a CONSTRUCTOR.

The constructor is used as a template for 
more codes with changes to what type of
values they may hold.

# CRUCIAL CODE
To achieve this, the CONSTRUCTOR is
used as a template.

The inquierer npm is installed,
 this will ask the user the question at 
 the start of the game.

as well as the export of files that 
are later called by another file.

### OVER-ALL
The game works and there will be continuous updates to it.
This will add new features such as,
    - Validation 
    - Colors 
With these two small things it will be used as a better example 
of a program that checks the users input.
Also, will display to the 
user what they can see within the game.
